Apr 18 22:10:41 <gunther>	goncalopp, why you hate freedom?
Apr 18 22:10:47 <neetismurder>	w
Apr 18 22:11:10 <goncalopp>	PM please
Apr 18 22:11:11 <nicckkk>	Goncalopp, I also have to leave in half an hour, so I'll get the first part of the lesson then read the rest. Is that alright?
Apr 18 22:11:26 <goncalopp>	sure nick
Apr 18 22:11:36 <goncalopp>	everyone, we're starting
Apr 18 22:11:42 <gunther>	okay
Apr 18 22:11:52 <Zeta_Labda>	alright!
Apr 18 22:12:03 <goncalopp>	I'll cover iterables first
Apr 18 22:12:26 <goncalopp>	hope everyone got the url, it's http://piratepad.net/1NHE9L0Go9
Apr 18 22:12:29 <goncalopp>	continuing...
Apr 18 22:12:57 <goncalopp>	an iterable is something you iterate over, obviously
Apr 18 22:13:11 <goncalopp>	iterating meaning, roughly, go through, one by one
Apr 18 22:13:32 <goncalopp>	An list is an example of an iterable, since it is composed o discrete items
Apr 18 22:13:41 <goncalopp>	I'll exemplify the creation of a list:
Apr 18 22:13:56 <goncalopp>	you can print lists directly:
Apr 18 22:14:13 <goncalopp>	try that for a moment, to see tthe output format
Apr 18 22:14:47 <goncalopp>	Now, a list can have any type inside, including integers, floats, strings, etc.
Apr 18 22:15:43 <goncalopp>	now, you can append something to a list (that means, adding something on the list's end)
Apr 18 22:15:47 <Zeta_Labda>	are dictionary´s iterables?
Apr 18 22:16:39 <goncalopp>	not by themselves, no, but they have methods that iterate over their keys and values
Apr 18 22:16:47 <goncalopp>	we'll cover dictionaries in another class, probably
Apr 18 22:17:16 <Zeta_Labda>	alright
Apr 18 22:17:20 <goncalopp>	now, how can you access an element in a list?
Apr 18 22:17:49 <goncalopp>	str_list[0] is an example of indexed access
Apr 18 22:18:25 <goncalopp>	in many programming classes, you can access the elements of a list/array by providing it's index
Apr 18 22:18:44 <goncalopp>	"str_list[0]" means "the first element of str_list"
Apr 18 22:18:58 <goncalopp>	"str_list[1]" would mean "the second element of str_list"
Apr 18 22:19:33 <goncalopp>	you may notice the indices start at 0, not 1. That's an old convention, and may take some time to get used to
Apr 18 22:19:37 <Zeta_Labda>	ofcourse
Apr 18 22:20:00 <Zeta_Labda>	well I find it somewhat logicial to begin with 0
Apr 18 22:20:17 <goncalopp>	it's very useful in practice, yes
Apr 18 22:20:24 <Usurper>	Do the " [ ] " brackets mean anything other than array?
Apr 18 22:20:26 <goncalopp>	Also, in python, you can access the last element of a list by using the index "-1"
Apr 18 22:20:37 <goncalopp>	the element before the last would be "-2"
Apr 18 22:20:52 <goncalopp>	so, in a list with three elements, l[1]==l[-2]
Apr 18 22:21:05 <goncalopp>	everyone following?
Apr 18 22:21:13 <Suhteevah>	mm
Apr 18 22:21:15 <neetismurder>	yup
Apr 18 22:21:19 <Usurper>	yes
Apr 18 22:21:20 <Josip>	ok
Apr 18 22:21:23 <Zeta_Labda>	ah ok
Apr 18 22:21:40 <goncalopp>	ok then
Apr 18 22:21:50 <goncalopp>	next up: slices
Apr 18 22:22:10 <goncalopp>	slices are a python convenience, don't expect them to appear on other programming languages
Apr 18 22:22:21 <goncalopp>	except modern interpreted ones, really
Apr 18 22:22:40 <goncalopp>	a "slice", as it sounds, is a piece of something
Apr 18 22:22:56 <goncalopp>	let's say you have a list with the numbers 0..10
Apr 18 22:23:24 *	Fane has quit ()
Apr 18 22:23:28 <goncalopp>	as you may remember from last class, range(10) will return a list with those
Apr 18 22:23:42 <neetismurder>	range(11)
Apr 18 22:23:56 <goncalopp>	thanks :)
Apr 18 22:24:01 <goncalopp>	I keep missing that
Apr 18 22:24:01 <neetismurder>	np
Apr 18 22:24:27 *	Anonymous968574 (80fa05f6@gateway/web/freenode/ip.128.250.5.246) has joined ##programming-classes
Apr 18 22:24:31 <goncalopp>	now, let's say I want to take only the first five elements of that list:
Apr 18 22:25:17 <goncalopp>	here. l_ten[0:5] means "the elements from indices 0 to (not including) five
Apr 18 22:25:22 <Zeta_Labda>	so you basically say, take everything from the first key till the fifth key?
Apr 18 22:25:36 <goncalopp>	fifth index, yes
Apr 18 22:25:46 <goncalopp>	don't confuse indices and keys
Apr 18 22:25:46 <Zeta_Labda>	ah
Apr 18 22:25:59 <Zeta_Labda>	gotta go, somewhat of an emergency, do you guys mind it?
Apr 18 22:26:25 <goncalopp>	go ahead Zeta, we're here if you can return later :)
Apr 18 22:26:43 <Zeta_Labda>	I hope so;)
Apr 18 22:26:45 *	Zeta_Labda has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Apr 18 22:26:49 <goncalopp>	ok
Apr 18 22:27:10 <goncalopp>	also: if you want your slice starting in the beggining of the list, you may ommit it
Apr 18 22:27:12 <goncalopp>	like this:
Apr 18 22:27:32 <goncalopp>	l_first_five and l_first_five2 are exactly the same
Apr 18 22:27:34 <Usurper>	What's the difference there?
Apr 18 22:27:56 <Usurper>	I see
Apr 18 22:28:00 <goncalopp>	just one less character to type, really, Usurper :)
Apr 18 22:28:02 <Usurper>	nvm
Apr 18 22:28:35 <goncalopp>	also, if you ommit the second number, it'll assume it to be  the end of the list
Apr 18 22:28:53 <goncalopp>	got it?
Apr 18 22:29:01 <Usurper>	Y
Apr 18 22:29:07 <Josip>	yep
Apr 18 22:29:07 <goncalopp>	ok
Apr 18 22:29:20 <goncalopp>	let's say you wanted the last three elements:
Apr 18 22:29:50 <Suhteevah>	could you also do [7:]?
Apr 18 22:30:06 <Anonymous968574>	could you just do l_ten_copy= l_ten instead of l_ten_copy= l_ten[:]?
Apr 18 22:30:08 <goncalopp>	sure, but that only works if you know the length of the list
Apr 18 22:30:24 <goncalopp>	which, btw, can be obtained with len(l_ten)
Apr 18 22:30:45 <goncalopp>	great question, anonymous
Apr 18 22:30:56 <Anonymous968574>	thx
Apr 18 22:31:05 <goncalopp>	I'll show you guys the difference
Apr 18 22:31:49 <goncalopp>	try this code, everyone
Apr 18 22:32:09 <goncalopp>	It may prove surprising :)
Apr 18 22:32:17 <neetismurder>	it's because lists behave differently than variables correct?
Apr 18 22:32:27 <goncalopp>	somewhat
Apr 18 22:32:33 <goncalopp>	more guesses?
Apr 18 22:32:44 <gunther>	it creates a copy?
Apr 18 22:32:52 <gunther>	for l3
Apr 18 22:33:10 <goncalopp>	exactly. That's the difference between "being a copy" and "being the same"
Apr 18 22:33:18 <goncalopp>	l1 and l2 are *the same*
Apr 18 22:33:37 <goncalopp>	whatever you do to one, happens on the other. because there's no "other", really
Apr 18 22:33:46 <Anonymous968574>	aah, now it makes sense
Apr 18 22:33:56 <goncalopp>	now, ofc, this doesn't happen with variables
Apr 18 22:34:11 <goncalopp>	(such as integers)
Apr 18 22:34:26 <neetismurder>	mutable vs. immutable right?
Apr 18 22:35:03 <goncalopp>	No, not really, NiM, though it's a related concept
Apr 18 22:35:23 <goncalopp>	it's the difference between "pass by value" and "pass by reference"
Apr 18 22:35:43 <goncalopp>	variables are always passed as values. You can't copy a value, it makes no sense
Apr 18 22:36:07 <goncalopp>	however, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and other OBJECTS, are passed by reference
Apr 18 22:36:26 <goncalopp>	You'll understand this better as soon as we cover Object Oriented Programming
Apr 18 22:36:32 <goncalopp>	which will be another class
Apr 18 22:37:00 <goncalopp>	any questions? everyone's comfortable?
Apr 18 22:37:10 <Usurper>	Y
Apr 18 22:37:11 <neetismurder>	yup
Apr 18 22:37:14 <Anonymous968574>	yep
Apr 18 22:37:16 <gunther>	syeah
Apr 18 22:37:17 <Josip>	ok here
Apr 18 22:37:25 <goncalopp>	back to lists, then :)
Apr 18 22:37:50 <goncalopp>	as you can add elements, you can also remove them:
Apr 18 22:38:10 <goncalopp>	pop(0) removes the element with index 0
Apr 18 22:38:45 <goncalopp>	also, you can insert an item in a specific place:
Apr 18 22:39:47 <neetismurder>	is there a way to remove an item without returning its value?
Apr 18 22:39:55 <goncalopp>	as you can see, indices are omnipresent in every operation with iterables
Apr 18 22:40:23 <goncalopp>	not that I know of, but you don't need to take the return value into a variable, really
Apr 18 22:40:48 <goncalopp>	some more methods:
Apr 18 22:41:22 <goncalopp>	this returns the number of occurences of 1 inside the list (3)
Apr 18 22:41:32 <Josip>	so pop works with int only?
Apr 18 22:41:52 <goncalopp>	Each and every of these methods work with any type
Apr 18 22:42:17 <goncalopp>	inside the list, is that what you mean, Josip?
Apr 18 22:42:24 <Josip>	yes
Apr 18 22:42:30 <goncalopp>	ok
Apr 18 22:42:34 <Anonymous968574>	is there something like .insert for strings?
Apr 18 22:42:46 <goncalopp>	yes and no
Apr 18 22:43:06 <goncalopp>	strings in python are what NiM talked about earlier - immutable
Apr 18 22:43:17 <goncalopp>	that means they can't be changed
Apr 18 22:43:51 <goncalopp>	(which doesn't mean you can't change the string the variable points to, but that's another story)
Apr 18 22:44:16 <goncalopp>	we'll be covering strings next, I'll how you how to do that then
Apr 18 22:44:21 <Anonymous968574>	ok
Apr 18 22:44:39 <goncalopp>	another useful method is "index"
Apr 18 22:45:10 <goncalopp>	i==1, since that's 5's index inside the list
Apr 18 22:45:40 <goncalopp>	also, you can concatenate lists:
Apr 18 22:46:09 <goncalopp>	like this
Apr 18 22:46:36 <goncalopp>	you can also sort lists with the sorted() method
Apr 18 22:47:21 <goncalopp>	sorted(l3) returns a sorted COPY of the list
Apr 18 22:47:45 <goncalopp>	if you did l3.sort() it would sort the list "in place", which means it would modify l3 to be sorted
Apr 18 22:47:54 <goncalopp>	all ok?
Apr 18 22:48:04 <Josip>	ok
Apr 18 22:48:05 <Anonymous968574>	y
Apr 18 22:48:10 <gunther>	yep
Apr 18 22:48:12 <Usurper>	Y
Apr 18 22:48:17 <neetismurder>	so sorted is a built-in function and .sort is a method?
Apr 18 22:48:24 <goncalopp>	yes
Apr 18 22:48:37 <goncalopp>	a method of "list"
Apr 18 22:48:41 <neetismurder>	also, can you index from the last position?
Apr 18 22:48:56 <goncalopp>	that would be the minus notation?
Apr 18 22:49:07 <neetismurder>	with the method, I mean
Apr 18 22:49:20 <neetismurder>	get a negative return value
Apr 18 22:49:32 <goncalopp>	from sort=
Apr 18 22:49:33 <goncalopp>	?
Apr 18 22:49:42 <neetismurder>	from l.index
Apr 18 22:49:49 <goncalopp>	oh
Apr 18 22:49:51 <neetismurder>	is there a way to do that in reverse?
Apr 18 22:49:55 <goncalopp>	not that I know of
Apr 18 22:50:08 <Anonymous968574>	maybe something like len(l)-l.index?
Apr 18 22:50:08 <goncalopp>	but you can always subtract it from the length of the list
Apr 18 22:50:33 <goncalopp>	almost
Apr 18 22:50:35 <goncalopp>	let's see
Apr 18 22:51:30 <goncalopp>	it's be  -(len(l)-l.index)  i believe
Apr 18 22:51:37 <goncalopp>	*it'd
Apr 18 22:52:01 <goncalopp>	or -len(l)+l.index    , remember your math people :)
Apr 18 22:52:30 <goncalopp>	Ok, I think we're done with lists, unless someone has anything to add
Apr 18 22:52:35 <neetismurder>	but if it was in the list multiple times
Apr 18 22:52:39 <neetismurder>	that wouldn't work right?
Apr 18 22:52:59 <goncalopp>	index() return the index of the first occurence, only
Apr 18 22:53:25 <neetismurder>	so you would have to make a reversed copy of the list to get the last occurence?
Apr 18 22:53:30 <neetismurder>	and run index on that?
Apr 18 22:53:37 <goncalopp>	that's one option, yes
Apr 18 22:53:53 <Anonymous968574>	I think I found a way to do it
Apr 18 22:53:54 <goncalopp>	don't forget to recalculate the index after that, since you inverted it
Apr 18 22:54:08 <neetismurder>	okay thanks, sorry for derailing
Apr 18 22:54:12 <goncalopp>	np
Apr 18 22:54:15 <goncalopp>	to do what, anon?
Apr 18 22:54:31 <Anonymous968574>	for example if you wanted to find the index of the third 1 in l
Apr 18 22:54:40 <Anonymous968574>	you could do l.index(1,3)
Apr 18 22:54:42 <goncalopp>	oh, fire away :)
Apr 18 22:54:49 <goncalopp>	yes?
Apr 18 22:55:17 <goncalopp>	oh, I see what you mean
Apr 18 22:55:24 <goncalopp>	you're not exactly right, though
Apr 18 22:55:27 <Anonymous968574>	oh wait, I think it doesn't work
Apr 18 22:55:40 <goncalopp>	that 3 doesn't mean "the third 1"
Apr 18 22:55:46 <Anonymous968574>	it seemed worked with the second
Apr 18 22:55:59 <goncalopp>	it means "the first 1 after index 3"
Apr 18 22:56:53 <neetismurder>	so you could use that to iterate to the last occurence though
Apr 18 22:56:59 <neetismurder>	right?
Apr 18 22:57:07 <goncalopp>	sure, in a loop :)
Apr 18 22:57:16 <Anonymous968574>	then you can do l.index(1,l.index(1,l.index(1)+1)+1)
Apr 18 22:57:18 <goncalopp>	I may use that as homework ;)
Apr 18 22:57:25 <goncalopp>	hoa
Apr 18 22:57:41 <goncalopp>	yes, anon, well done :D
Apr 18 22:57:44 <goncalopp>	(I think so)
Apr 18 22:57:47 <Anonymous968574>	yay!
Apr 18 22:58:07 <goncalopp>	That begs for a recursive function... another day :)
Apr 18 22:58:42 <goncalopp>	ok, no more questions?
Apr 18 22:59:03 <neetismurder>	all set
Apr 18 22:59:11 <Anonymous968574>	I'm good
Apr 18 22:59:57 <Josip>	me 2
Apr 18 23:00:04 <goncalopp>	ok then, I want to show you guys how I answered anon's question about index's second argument
Apr 18 23:00:24 <goncalopp>	fire up python in a shell (open cmd and type "python" then enter)
Apr 18 23:00:48 <goncalopp>	you should get a  ">>>" prompt
Apr 18 23:01:03 <goncalopp>	this is the interactive interpreter
Apr 18 23:01:18 <goncalopp>	you can do anything here that you type on your editor
Apr 18 23:01:26 <goncalopp>	declaring variables, printing, etc
Apr 18 23:01:37 <neetismurder>	I hate functions in idle ; ;
Apr 18 23:01:42 <goncalopp>	it's great for playing in a sandbox
Apr 18 23:02:16 <goncalopp>	what about them, nim? I don't know much about idle
Apr 18 23:02:32 <goncalopp>	also, try declaring a list with "l=[]"
Apr 18 23:02:44 <goncalopp>	and then call   "help(l.index)"
Apr 18 23:02:58 <neetismurder>	idle is what you get when you run the interpreter right? You can't go back and fix your mistakes easily or visibly, you have to rewrite the whole thing
Apr 18 23:03:07 <goncalopp>	press "q" to exit help (on unix, at least)
Apr 18 23:03:12 <neetismurder>	with functions and procedures
Apr 18 23:03:33 <goncalopp>	oh, yes, I thought you were talking about the editor
Apr 18 23:03:54 <goncalopp>	yes, everyone, writing functions inside the interactive interpreter is very messy, error prone, and slow
Apr 18 23:04:03 <goncalopp>	just use it for quick tests and help
Apr 18 23:04:11 <goncalopp>	also, another neat trick:
Apr 18 23:04:22 *	Volens has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
Apr 18 23:04:24 <goncalopp>	dir(l) will tell you all the methods you can call on the list l
Apr 18 23:04:59 <Josip>	wow!
Apr 18 23:05:05 <goncalopp>	ok, that's about it about the interpreter, for now
Apr 18 23:05:17 <neetismurder>	that's awesome
Apr 18 23:05:25 <goncalopp>	oh, ctrl-c to clear a command in progress
Apr 18 23:05:40 <goncalopp>	Josip, nim, that's the magic of python's introspection
Apr 18 23:05:45 <neetismurder>	how do I clear the screen again?
Apr 18 23:05:55 <goncalopp>	We'll have a class about introspection and reflection, eventually
Apr 18 23:06:18 <goncalopp>	idk, really, never needed to :P
Apr 18 23:06:58 <goncalopp>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/517970/how-to-clear-python-interpreter-console
Apr 18 23:07:07 <goncalopp>	not easy, really
Apr 18 23:07:20 <goncalopp>	anyway, ctrl-d  to exit
Apr 18 23:07:32 <goncalopp>	or exit(), i believe
Apr 18 23:07:43 <neetismurder>	lol lambda
Apr 18 23:07:48 <goncalopp>	so, let's get into string processing?
Apr 18 23:08:06 <goncalopp>	(lambda is awesome, let's do a functional programming class sometime)
Apr 18 23:08:34 <neetismurder>	:)
Apr 18 23:09:01 <goncalopp>	ok, no one's complaining, I'm moving forward :)
Apr 18 23:09:04 <goncalopp>	strings!
Apr 18 23:10:14 <goncalopp>	ok, as you can see, strings act just like lists
Apr 18 23:10:41 <goncalopp>	however, you can't use some list methods on strings, as anon asked earlier, I believe
Apr 18 23:10:59 <neetismurder>	s should be s1
Apr 18 23:11:10 <goncalopp>	thanks
Apr 18 23:11:14 <goncalopp>	dir("") for those curious, returns this:

Apr 18 23:11:43 <goncalopp>	always ignore things starting with _
Apr 18 23:11:49 <goncalopp>	(for now)
Apr 18 23:12:03 <goncalopp>	as you can see, strings have index()
Apr 18 23:12:15 <goncalopp>	also, lower:
Apr 18 23:13:27 <goncalopp>	startswith return a boolean
Apr 18 23:13:35 <goncalopp>	that's "True" or "False"
Apr 18 23:13:49 <Josip>	 :)
Apr 18 23:13:56 <goncalopp>	strip() removes whitespace from the beggining and end of the string
Apr 18 23:14:18 <goncalopp>	examples of whitespace are the space character, a tab, etc
Apr 18 23:14:19 <Usurper>	"startswith" is a T/F syntax?
Apr 18 23:14:33 <goncalopp>	startswith is a method that returns T/F
Apr 18 23:14:50 <goncalopp>	you can test conditions with it:
Apr 18 23:14:54 <Josip>	can you remove only whitespace from end?
Apr 18 23:15:35 <goncalopp>	I'm not sure, but I'll check
Apr 18 23:15:46 <Josip>	ok
Apr 18 23:16:13 <goncalopp>	yes, there's the methods lstrp() and rstrip(), meaning left and right
Apr 18 23:16:25 <Josip>	:) thanks
Apr 18 23:16:35 <goncalopp>	here, the python documentation is always useful, everyone:
Apr 18 23:16:36 <goncalopp>	http://docs.python.org/library/string.html
Apr 18 23:16:59 <goncalopp>	learing to use the docs and google them is homework :)
Apr 18 23:17:39 <goncalopp>	I won't cover any more string methods, since there's so many of them
Apr 18 23:17:47 <goncalopp>	Let's do some exercises :)
Apr 18 23:18:52 <goncalopp>	Gunther, you're up for it?
Apr 18 23:18:58 <gunther>	sure
Apr 18 23:19:36 <goncalopp>	can you show us two different ways to get that date (2012-04-18) into another variable?
Apr 18 23:19:50 <goncalopp>	silly ways are ok :)
Apr 18 23:20:52 *	Volens (~mintyten@211.108.159.201) has joined ##programming-classes
Apr 18 23:21:34 <goncalopp>	ok, gunther is afk for a moment, Josip, can you do it?
Apr 18 23:22:57 <goncalopp>	ok Josip's asleep, am I that boring? lol
Apr 18 23:23:02 <Anonymous968574>	lol
Apr 18 23:23:05 <goncalopp>	NiM, can I count on you?
Apr 18 23:23:11 <neetismurder>	okay
Apr 18 23:24:33 <goncalopp>	don't forget the quotes
Apr 18 23:24:37 <goncalopp>	yup
Apr 18 23:24:39 <gunther>	back
Apr 18 23:24:52 <goncalopp>	you're next then :)
Apr 18 23:25:13 <gunther>	what must i do?
Apr 18 23:25:35 <goncalopp>	let NiM finish, then I'm teaching something for you to use
Apr 18 23:26:21 <neetismurder>	oops
Apr 18 23:26:28 <goncalopp>	a 6 there NiM, other than that perfectly done, thanks!
Apr 18 23:26:36 <Josip>	sorry, had to silece my cat
Apr 18 23:26:54 <goncalopp>	np Josip, get up to speed then we'll get to you
Apr 18 23:26:59 <goncalopp>	ok then
Apr 18 23:27:16 <goncalopp>	There's something I want to show you:
Apr 18 23:27:27 <goncalopp>	try this code:
Apr 18 23:27:45 <goncalopp>	"cada" in "abracadabra"
Apr 18 23:28:04 <goncalopp>	exactly like that (with a print if you're using the editor)
Apr 18 23:28:27 <goncalopp>	as you can see, "in" tests for a substring inside another
Apr 18 23:28:35 <goncalopp>	all ok?
Apr 18 23:28:52 <Josip>	True
Apr 18 23:28:53 <neetismurder>	yup
Apr 18 23:28:56 <Usurper>	y
Apr 18 23:28:59 <Anonymous968574>	yep
Apr 18 23:29:07 <goncalopp>	ok then
Apr 18 23:29:45 <goncalopp>	Gunther, using this and NiM's work, can you show us two ways of checking if the year inside the date is "2012"?
Apr 18 23:30:19 <gunther>	I'll try
Apr 18 23:31:13 <goncalopp>	you can safely assume that the year is the only 4 digit number in the date, ofc
Apr 18 23:32:56 <goncalopp>	still thinking?
Apr 18 23:33:06 <gunther>	yeah
Apr 18 23:34:23 <goncalopp>	ok. anyone remembers any string method we could use here?
Apr 18 23:34:32 <Anonymous968574>	I have one
Apr 18 23:34:36 <Josip>	str()
Apr 18 23:34:43 <neetismurder>	startswith right?
Apr 18 23:34:45 <goncalopp>	fire, anon :)
Apr 18 23:34:55 <goncalopp>	yeah, sure, NiM
Apr 18 23:35:06 <goncalopp>	Josip, didn't quite get what you meant
Apr 18 23:35:15 <Josip>	nwm
Apr 18 23:35:25 <goncalopp>	ok :)
Apr 18 23:35:48 <goncalopp>	ok, that works, gunther, thanks :)
Apr 18 23:36:26 <goncalopp>	anon, also
Apr 18 23:36:42 *	Zeta_Labda (~Zeta_Labd@ip4da58b7a.direct-adsl.nl) has joined ##programming-classes
Apr 18 23:37:20 <goncalopp>	Ok, next up, the split method!
Apr 18 23:37:45 <Zeta_Labda>	still talking about lists?
Apr 18 23:37:54 <gunther>	strings
Apr 18 23:38:05 <goncalopp>	we did string processing, and we're doing exercises now, zeta
Apr 18 23:38:23 <goncalopp>	here, "numbers" is now a list of strings:
Apr 18 23:39:14 <goncalopp>	also, you can do the reverse (for strings, at least)
Apr 18 23:40:44 <goncalopp>	be careful about the spaces when using split, too
Apr 18 23:40:57 <goncalopp>	all ok?
Apr 18 23:41:07 <Josip>	y
Apr 18 23:41:09 <neetismurder>	can split take multiple arguments?
Apr 18 23:41:25 <goncalopp>	as in "split if any of these occurr"?
Apr 18 23:41:29 <neetismurder>	yes
Apr 18 23:41:41 <goncalopp>	no. you can do that using the re module, though
Apr 18 23:41:58 <neetismurder>	ok
Apr 18 23:42:18 <goncalopp>	ok then
Apr 18 23:42:22 <Usurper>	How much longer?
Apr 18 23:42:35 <goncalopp>	Pointing to a 2 hour class
Apr 18 23:42:43 <goncalopp>	so, 18 minutes here
Apr 18 23:43:19 <Zeta_Labda>	re module?
Apr 18 23:43:28 <goncalopp>	So, Josip, can you get the year, month and day in three different variables?
Apr 18 23:44:16 <goncalopp>	regular expressions, zeta. an advanced topic, really
Apr 18 23:44:37 <goncalopp>	but here you go anyway http://docs.python.org/library/re.html
Apr 18 23:44:42 <neetismurder>	you have to load a module for regex?
Apr 18 23:45:01 <goncalopp>	yes. python's not perl :)
Apr 18 23:45:13 <goncalopp>	it's a general purpose language
Apr 18 23:46:24 <goncalopp>	Josip, it'd be best if you could use split()
Apr 18 23:46:50 *	Usurper has quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.88.2 [Firefox 11.0/20120312181643])
Apr 18 23:47:20 <goncalopp>	sure, now use indexed access
Apr 18 23:48:47 <goncalopp>	ok, I get where that comes from. The concepts are similar, and prone to confusion
Apr 18 23:49:10 <goncalopp>	l[0] returns the "first element of the list"
Apr 18 23:49:26 <goncalopp>	l.index(0) returns "the index of 0 in the list"
Apr 18 23:50:00 <Anonymous968574>	so they're pretty much the opposite?
Apr 18 23:50:02 <goncalopp>	Josip, here, you want the *elements* you have splited, not to look inside them
Apr 18 23:50:17 <goncalopp>	arguably anon, it's pretty much subjective
Apr 18 23:50:46 <neetismurder>	wouldn't it be easier to split on date1 or date2 too?
Apr 18 23:50:53 <goncalopp>	there :)
Apr 18 23:51:04 <goncalopp>	oh, well spotted
Apr 18 23:51:24 <goncalopp>	can't be done on s, or else the first element would be "Today's date is 2012"
Apr 18 23:51:31 <Josip>	:)
Apr 18 23:51:57 <goncalopp>	also, something I neglected to tell you
Apr 18 23:52:14 <goncalopp>	it's convention that all variables start with a lowercase character
Apr 18 23:53:03 <Anonymous968574>	lists too?
Apr 18 23:53:08 <goncalopp>	also, here's some shorthand for Josip's work, courtesy of python's flexible assignment operator:
Apr 18 23:53:24 <goncalopp>	yes, *all* variable names
Apr 18 23:53:46 <goncalopp>	there, just one line :)
Apr 18 23:53:58 <Anonymous968574>	neat!
Apr 18 23:54:05 <goncalopp>	ofc, you must be sure v has exactly 3 elements
Apr 18 23:54:09 <Josip>	Yeeaahh!
Apr 18 23:54:13 <goncalopp>	yes, python's awesome :)
Apr 18 23:54:33 <goncalopp>	also, in this way, you don't really need a temporary variable:
Apr 18 23:54:37 <neetismurder>	that's pretty neat
Apr 18 23:54:45 <goncalopp>	so, 4 lines in 1 :)
Apr 18 23:55:10 <neetismurder>	you could even stick date1 in there too right?
Apr 18 23:55:24 <neetismurder>	the value I mean
Apr 18 23:55:30 <goncalopp>	sure:
Apr 18 23:56:10 <goncalopp>	ok, one last thing: tuples
Apr 18 23:56:29 <goncalopp>	tuples are just like lists, but they are *not* modifiable
Apr 18 23:56:38 <gunther>	I think i've seen these before
Apr 18 23:57:09 <goncalopp>	probably. they're used, for example, to return several arguments in a function
Apr 18 23:57:13 <goncalopp>	example
Apr 18 23:58:27 <goncalopp>	anything fuzzy on that function for anyone?
Apr 18 23:59:39 <goncalopp>	I may have overdone it :)
Apr 18 23:59:48 <Josip>	a bit...
Apr 18 23:59:53 <goncalopp>	xD
Apr 18 23:59:57 <goncalopp>	ok, ok :)
Apr 19 00:00:59 <goncalopp>	here you go, expanded version
Apr 19 00:01:28 <goncalopp>	this accepts two arguments, a character (string of length 1) and a string
Apr 19 00:01:49 <goncalopp>	then, it returns how many of those characters are in the string, in upper and lowercase variations
Apr 19 00:02:01 <Zeta_Labda>	.lower and .upper are standard functions of python?
Apr 19 00:02:06 <Josip>	aha, got it
Apr 19 00:02:11 <goncalopp>	of strings, zeta
Apr 19 00:02:31 *	Anonymous968574 has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
Apr 19 00:02:31 <goncalopp>	string.lower()
Apr 19 00:03:03 <goncalopp>	anyone's having trouble understanding the function?
Apr 19 00:03:05 <Zeta_Labda>	alright, so what´s the use of the first line?
Apr 19 00:03:31 <goncalopp>	none, if you specify your character as uppercase :)
Apr 19 00:03:34 <goncalopp>	*lower
Apr 19 00:03:48 <Zeta_Labda>	ok
Apr 19 00:05:02 <neetismurder>	can you switch values like this?
Apr 19 00:05:08 <neetismurder>	like x,y = y,x?
Apr 19 00:05:14 <goncalopp>	yes :D
Apr 19 00:05:23 <goncalopp>	no need for a temporary variable, as usual
Apr 19 00:05:26 <neetismurder>	cool
Apr 19 00:06:00 <goncalopp>	ok then, I think I'll finish the class here. For those who want to stay a little more, I'd like to show you some things on Josip's homework
Apr 19 00:06:14 *	gunther has quit (Quit: leaving)
Apr 19 00:06:48 <neetismurder>	I've still got time, but I'm going to take a restroom break
Apr 19 00:07:15 *	Volens has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
Apr 19 00:07:21 <goncalopp>	ok sure. I think we can all use a 5 minutes break, really
Apr 19 00:07:35 <goncalopp>	So, brb :)
Apr 19 00:07:44 <Josip>	:)
Apr 19 00:13:03 <goncalopp>	Ok, I'm back
Apr 19 00:13:13 <goncalopp>	I'll post Josip's work so you can study it for a bit
Apr 19 00:15:33 <neetismurder>	back
Apr 19 00:15:40 <goncalopp>	:)
Apr 19 00:16:54 <Zeta_Labda>	oh that´s well done(what´s currently on the pad(
Apr 19 00:16:57 <Zeta_Labda>	)
Apr 19 00:17:13 <goncalopp>	ok, everyone's got a good idea of how everything works here?
Apr 19 00:17:20 <neetismurder>	I would :%s/warning/10/g
Apr 19 00:17:23 <neetismurder>	and delete line 3
Apr 19 00:17:32 <goncalopp>	yes zeta, Josip's work is pretty clean
Apr 19 00:17:51 <goncalopp>	nim, don't talk vim to us :)
Apr 19 00:18:02 <neetismurder>	sorry :3
Apr 19 00:18:22 <neetismurder>	I'd not use the variable and just use 10
Apr 19 00:18:29 <neetismurder>	since it's less typing
Apr 19 00:18:56 <neetismurder>	but it's a lot cleaner than what I did
Apr 19 00:18:56 <goncalopp>	it is, NiM, but using a variable instead of repeating a value is considered best practice
Apr 19 00:19:08 <goncalopp>	don't worry too much about one line more
Apr 19 00:19:20 <goncalopp>	And, this is actually what I want to talk about
Apr 19 00:19:41 <goncalopp>	rule 1 of clean programming: never, EVER, repeat anything
Apr 19 00:20:01 <goncalopp>	it will lead to you changing something later, and forgetting to change it everywhere
Apr 19 00:20:42 <goncalopp>	sure, it may seem like you won't forget them, or you can use find/replace, but on big projects you'll have HUNDREDS of references in multiple files
Apr 19 00:20:47 <goncalopp>	so just don't do it!
Apr 19 00:21:31 <goncalopp>	with this in mind, I want you to take a close look on lines 8,9,10,11
Apr 19 00:21:42 <goncalopp>	notice how they are very, very similar
Apr 19 00:21:51 <goncalopp>	9, 11 are actually the same
Apr 19 00:22:09 <goncalopp>	now, this is a clear cut case to just *use a function*
Apr 19 00:22:15 <goncalopp>	again: NEVER repeat code
Apr 19 00:22:38 <neetismurder>	gotcha
Apr 19 00:22:53 <goncalopp>	As you may point out, lines 8 and 10 are alike, but not the same...
Apr 19 00:23:05 <goncalopp>	the solution here is to think about what they are doing:
Apr 19 00:23:32 <goncalopp>	you want to check if the secret_number is in a interval around the user_number
Apr 19 00:23:41 <goncalopp>	so:
Apr 19 00:24:41 <goncalopp>	this is a docstring, it's just a special kind of comment
Apr 19 00:25:15 <goncalopp>	there's two ways of doing this that I can think of:
Apr 19 00:26:43 <goncalopp>	abs() is the absolute value
Apr 19 00:26:51 <goncalopp>	abs(2)==abs(-2)==2
Apr 19 00:26:59 <goncalopp>	abs(-3)==3
Apr 19 00:26:59 <goncalopp>	etc
Apr 19 00:27:00 <neetismurder>	you don't need math for absolute value?
Apr 19 00:27:10 <goncalopp>	no, just use abs()
Apr 19 00:27:14 <goncalopp>	i think....
Apr 19 00:27:29 <neetismurder>	oh cool
Apr 19 00:27:30 <goncalopp>	yes.
Apr 19 00:27:35 <Josip>	nice
Apr 19 00:27:44 <goncalopp>	so, finishing our program:
Apr 19 00:28:43 <neetismurder>	and you can use that for the elif too right?
Apr 19 00:28:48 <neetismurder>	the false value?
Apr 19 00:28:51 <goncalopp>	this condition is unnecessary_
Apr 19 00:29:14 <goncalopp>	if you test for equality first:
Apr 19 00:29:54 <goncalopp>	testing for equality is cheaper (in computer time)
Apr 19 00:30:08 <goncalopp>	also, more readable than that long long line :)
Apr 19 00:30:35 <Josip>	much more readable
Apr 19 00:30:42 <goncalopp>	NiM, I think this is what you were saying?
Apr 19 00:30:58 <neetismurder>	yup
Apr 19 00:31:03 <neetismurder>	that's what I did first
Apr 19 00:31:06 *	Sativa_ (~Sativa@c-76-105-30-21.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) has joined ##programming-classes
Apr 19 00:31:12 <neetismurder>	but mine isn't too readable ww
Apr 19 00:31:36 <goncalopp>	no, it isn't :)
Apr 19 00:31:40 <goncalopp>	shall we go over it?
Apr 19 00:31:47 <neetismurder>	sure
Apr 19 00:32:10 <Josip>	g2g its 1:30am here
Apr 19 00:32:26 <neetismurder>	take care
Apr 19 00:32:30 <Josip>	bb
Apr 19 00:32:33 *	Zeta_Labda has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
Apr 19 00:32:44 <goncalopp>	sure, good night :)
Apr 19 00:32:46 *	Josip (~chatzilla@cable-188-246-58-157.dynamic.kdsinter.net) has left ##programming-classes
Apr 19 00:33:10 <goncalopp>	now, NiM's program is a mythical beast :)
Apr 19 00:33:26 <neetismurder>	wah
Apr 19 00:33:30 <goncalopp>	xP
Apr 19 00:33:57 <goncalopp>	It works, of course :D
Apr 19 00:34:10 <goncalopp>	a couple of things, though:
Apr 19 00:34:11 <neetismurder>	barely... lol
Apr 19 00:34:48 <neetismurder>	those global variable definitions really bother me
Apr 19 00:35:02 <goncalopp>	yes, that's what I was gonna say next
Apr 19 00:35:04 <neetismurder>	but I'm used to js scoping, so I wasn't really sure how to get the same behavior
Apr 19 00:35:11 <goncalopp>	globals are ALWAYS a bad sign
Apr 19 00:35:32 <neetismurder>	I know python3 has nonlocal right?
Apr 19 00:35:38 <goncalopp>	yup
Apr 19 00:35:44 <goncalopp>	ok, we'll review this...
Apr 19 00:35:45 <neetismurder>	how do I do that in 2?
Apr 19 00:35:59 <goncalopp>	you shouldn't, for something this simple
Apr 19 00:36:04 <goncalopp>	and you can't, anyway
Apr 19 00:36:11 <neetismurder>	oh alright
Apr 19 00:36:32 <goncalopp>	the best way to do it in this case, is just to pass the values as arguments:
Apr 19 00:37:05 <goncalopp>	let's see if I can uderstand this xP
Apr 19 00:38:10 <goncalopp>	there... what else?...
Apr 19 00:38:26 <neetismurder>	guesses was global
Apr 19 00:38:30 <goncalopp>	oh, on line 27, nim:
Apr 19 00:38:52 <goncalopp>	just a bit more readable
Apr 19 00:39:08 <neetismurder>	yeah, I changed it after I was getting undefined local variable errors
Apr 19 00:39:16 <goncalopp>	hoa
Apr 19 00:39:19 <neetismurder>	it was originally like that, but I never changed it back
Apr 19 00:39:24 <neetismurder>	after I fixed em
Apr 19 00:39:46 <goncalopp>	well, when you need a variable, just pass it as an argument, that's about it
Apr 19 00:39:57 <neetismurder>	okay, I almost did that too
Apr 19 00:40:16 <neetismurder>	but it felt awkward because I'm too used to lexical scoping
Apr 19 00:40:17 <goncalopp>	I think these may not be the best choices for the functions, but I may check that better later
Apr 19 00:40:53 *	Suhteevah has quit (*.net *.split)
Apr 19 00:41:00 <goncalopp>	javascript can give you a bad case of cold:)
Apr 19 00:41:16 <neetismurder>	ww yeah
Apr 19 00:41:25 <neetismurder>	on line 40
Apr 19 00:41:35 <neetismurder>	I should have combined the and statement right?
Apr 19 00:42:04 <neetismurder>	and combined 40 and 43 into a single function?
Apr 19 00:42:16 <goncalopp>	sure, same as Josip's
Apr 19 00:42:39 <goncalopp>	basically, if you have a 20+ lines function, you're doing something wrong :)
Apr 19 00:42:59 <goncalopp>	unless for some seriously advanced algorithms
Apr 19 00:43:08 <goncalopp>	also
Apr 19 00:43:41 <goncalopp>	"%s" % ("string") is deprecated
Apr 19 00:43:50 <goncalopp>	use string.format()
Apr 19 00:43:59 <neetismurder>	ah okay
Apr 19 00:44:10 <neetismurder>	guess python the hard way needs an update :P
Apr 19 00:44:13 <goncalopp>	though I'll confess I use it sometimes, since it's more compact :)
Apr 19 00:44:43 <neetismurder>	has that disappeared in python3?
Apr 19 00:45:06 <goncalopp>	Anyway, I'll try and rewrite your program entirely and sent it to you later, so you may get an idea of good structure (hopefully :)
Apr 19 00:45:16 <neetismurder>	alright thanks
Apr 19 00:45:30 <goncalopp>	np :)
Apr 19 00:45:46 <goncalopp>	nick, sativa, any questions, anything?
Apr 19 00:46:41 <goncalopp>	they got dazzled by tour code NiM ;)
Apr 19 00:46:47 <goncalopp>	*your
Apr 19 00:46:48 <neetismurder>	bahaha
Apr 19 00:47:01 <neetismurder>	maybe stunned by the ugliness
Apr 19 00:47:07 <goncalopp>	:)
Apr 19 00:48:32 <goncalopp>	ok then people, I must go, it's pretty late here I must get up early in the morning
Apr 19 00:48:48 <neetismurder>	alright thanks, next class and homework in email?
Apr 19 00:48:49 <goncalopp>	NiM, I'll send you something late tomorrow
Apr 19 00:49:09 <goncalopp>	yes, I found something cool for agreeing on class schedule
Apr 19 00:49:53 <goncalopp>	hope to see you guys next class. I'm pretty happy with how these are going :D
Apr 19 00:50:06 <neetismurder>	yep, I'm having fun with it
Apr 19 00:50:09 <neetismurder>	good night
Apr 19 00:50:15 <goncalopp>	good nigh/morning ;)
